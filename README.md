# Wz2100-mod-viewer

A lightweight web viewer for Warzone 2100 modding data. It reads the game's JSON stats and renders PIE models directly in the browser.

## Features

- Browse structures and weapons from the base game or uploaded stats.
- Preview PIE models, automatically stacking hard-point bases with their mounted weapons.
- Display build costs for both structures and their weapons, along with combined totals.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to explore the data.
